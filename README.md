# What is Fitness Food Tracker?

Fitness Food tracker is an app that allows users to create, store, and recall meals with access to a database of over 8000 foods. The nutritional information in the foods table was distributed by the USDA. Foods have attributes of a description, grams per serving, calories per serving, carbs, monosaturated fats, polysaturated fats, saturated fats, sugars, protein, sodium, cholesterol, and fiber.

# User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to search the database and see all entries containing keywords like â€œchicken"
- As a user I want to be able to see my last 5 meals
- As a user I want to be able to see my meals from a given date
- As a user I want to have an ideal macronutrient breakdown and see if my meal meets the ideal

# Things to improve

In order of priority:

- Make the foods table searchable by keyword
- Create an calorie goal calculator based on users age, weight, gender, etc. with designated macronutrients breakdown
- Total calories and macros for a given day.
- Make meals searchable by date
- Graph macronutrients of a given meal or day, and compare against goal designated by calculator.
- Make meals searchable by name
- Improve styling and flow of page
